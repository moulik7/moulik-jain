            <p> Benefits of Cricket
Cricket, the world’s second most popular spectator sport, can provide a fun way for
children of all ages to stay or get in shape. Cricket improves speed, agility, flexibility
and reflexes; it increases concentration, the ability to think strategically and to
utilize decision-making skills. Cricket also, unlike what most children are exposed to
in most American sports, prizes sportsmanship and fair play – self control, integrity
and respect for others is central to the game of cricket. Many children who are
reluctant to take part in team sports find themselves well suited for cricket.
Physical Benefits
Everyone who plays cricket can expect to experience physical benefits. For example,
sprinting between the wickets provides an excellent aerobic workout. Cricket shares
some basic foundations with some of the martial arts (or even dance and music for
that matter!). Some examples of these: measure, tempo change, timing, velocity, and
proper execution and simplification of technique. Therefore, children can associate
the learning from one subject or skill set to another, linking the common ground to
broaden their life perspective.
Mental Benefits
Cricket is an excellent mental exercise. Any cricketer who makes a serious effort to
learn the game cannot help but develop greater powers of observation and a greater
understanding of strategy. A cricketer, at the game’s top levels, must learn to
develop a complete repertoire of shots (if one is a batter) or variations in bowling (if
one is a bowler), and learn how to judge and determine their opponent’s thoughts
and character so as to anticipate their actions. The cricketer must learn to use this
ability to entice or draw an opponent into making a mistake, by leading them into
thinking that they are in control of the contest.
Social Benefits
Cricketers often become friends and competitors, finding themselves meeting
hundreds of people over the years as they travel to competitions locally, nationally,
and internationally. Not surprisingly, cricket is the fastest growing sport among
universities across Canada and United States. Very skilled players may have the
opportunity to train overseas, compete in prestigious tournaments, which in the
future may also include the Olympic Games.</p>
